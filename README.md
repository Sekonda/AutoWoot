# AutoWooter

This is just a mess about with the Plug.DJ API to try and get an AutoWooter working since the new (UI) update was released in November. 

If it works great, if it doesn't, well it's a mess about. 

## Usuage 

Drag [this](javascript:(function(\){$.getScript('https://raw.github.com/Sekonda/AutoWoot/master/loader.js'\);}(\)\);] to your bookmark toolbar and when you're in a Plug.DJ room click on it. Simples. 

*/aw kill* - This command will kill the autowooter. 
*/aw start* - This command will start up the autowooter.
