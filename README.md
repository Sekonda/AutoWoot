# AutoWooter

This is just a mess about with the Plug.DJ API to try and get an AutoWooter working since the new (UI) update was released in November. 

If it works great, if it doesn't, well it's a mess about. 

## Usuage 

Well... I thought it was going to be simple to add a bookmarklet as a link, but not so much. Any way, create a bookmark and set the URL to the following:

```javascript
javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://raw.github.com/Sekonda/AutoWoot/master/loader.js');}());
```

Once you've that done, just click on it when you're in a Plug.DJ Room. 

## Commands

There are some commands to start/stop the AutoWooter. 

*/aw kill* - This command will kill the autowooter. 

*/aw start* - This command will start up the autowooter.
